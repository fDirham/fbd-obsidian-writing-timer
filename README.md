# FBD Writing Timer

A simple writing timer. A button will show up on your status bar. Click it and you can set a timer for a writing session. Once it hits zero, you can see how many words you write.

NOTE: The plugin only tracks one file at a time. It will record the word count of the file currently opened when you start the timer.
